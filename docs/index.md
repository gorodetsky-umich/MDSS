# Multi-Disciplinary Simulation Suite (MDSS)

[`mdss`](https://github.com/gorodetsky-umich/mdss.git) is a Python package designed for running a series Aerodynamic and Aerostructural simulations using ADflow, and TACS simulations with mphys and openMDAO. This package provides streamlined functions to automate simulation test cases.

## Key Features
- Simplifies running multiple simulation cases.
- Integrates with Mphys and OpenMDAO for streamlined data management.
- Generates comparison plots for experimental conditions in each case.
